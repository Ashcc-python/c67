Before time was time, there was a Great Hill. 

And on the Great Hill there lived the Yolks.

The Yolks spent their entire lives climbing the Great Hill, trying to reach the top.




Some Yolks climbed fast.

Some Yolks climbed slowly.

One Yolk in particular was a very slow climber. He was different than the rest of the Yolks.





When he climbed, all the other Yolks passed him. 

It was hard for him to watch them pass by.

He felt like the worst climber in the world.

Some Yolks made fun of him as they passed.

Others didn’t.

Wally was sure that he wanted a pet.

He talked to his Dad about which pet to get.



“I want a Monkey who scratches his head!

He’d swing in the house and he’d jump on the bed.”



“Well,” said his Dad in a kind sort of way, 

“Did you know that monkeys eat bugs everyday?”



“Oh No,” Wally said, “We have none to eat.”

Mom likes to squash all the bugs with her feet.”



“Then I want a Hippo!” he screamed to his Dad.

“He’d eat all our trash, and Mom would be glad!”

The wolves in the woods, grow as wild as trees.

They do not say Thank You. They do not say Please. 

They roll in the dirt and they chomp and they growl.

At nighttime they look at the moon and they howl.

But Warren was different, the youngest wolf pup.

He would not go howl. He would not look up. 



Instead he ran back to his cave to go hide. 

And you would not believe what would happen inside.



The brightest full moon would cause Warren to change.
